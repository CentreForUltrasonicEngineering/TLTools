# cueTFM: The Centre for Ultrasonic Engineering Total Focussing Method library of code.

## Usage

TODO: basic usage from python.
TODO: More details in some pythonic repository.

## Philosophy and assumptions

The cueTFM kernel is written in CUDA for performance. 

The reference code is written in Python for easy teaching and debugging.

Lots of historical functionality has been culled, but is still mostly available in historical Matlab versions and historical .dll versions


cueTFM is a founding library behind cueART.

## Some famous quotes

"It does not make sense to get a wrong result really fast". (that is, "get things working correctly first", or "premature optimisation is the source of all evil")

"Cheap things often turn out to be not so cheap. Getting things for free costs a lot."

## Some history

A lot has happened before what You see could be gifted to You.

ToDo: Write about the history of cuBeam (2008), cuTFM, fminsearch, flatSurface refraction, poly surface refraction, trip to spain and the time-representation idea, symbolic polyfit, Tim's contribution, efficient PCF, Bristol's version, cueART, dll-isation, pythonisation, and the 2017 revival.


## Authors and contributions

* Dr Jerzy Dziewierz - author of the original idea behind beamsim (early 2008), fminsearch, refraction algorithms, original cuTFM, polyfit, and the cueTFM (coeff-enabled TFM). Experimental validation, documentation, presentations, training sessions, consultations e.t.c.; primary go-to person for in-depth questions.
* Dr Timothy Lardner - contributor to the cueTFM coeff table factorizing method; developer of the .dll and then, the Python interface up until mid-2017. 
* Dr Ailidh McGilp - debugging, developing of the 3D peritem surface technology. Spreading the word, and first real industrial application.
* Marcus Ingram - debugging.
* Professor Anthony Gachagan- long-time mentor. He's responsible for the world not collapsing any sooner.
* If you feel like You have contributed - don't be shy, ask for recognition!
